# Memeto

See example at [sielayltd.github.io/memeto](sielayltd.github.io/memeto).

> So many tools, so little time
 
Often you use Slack or email to ask similar questions:

> WHO IS project manager FOR example.com?
>
> WHAT project DEPENDS ON jQuery?
>
> WHERE IS Lukasz Sielski?

Why not make it work as your query language? Why not bind all that data in one place?

## Key facts

 * Based on awesome [MEANJS](http://meanjs.org) project
 * Currently both [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) and [OrientDB](http://orientdb.com)
 * It's __FREE__ also for commercial use, but all modifications have to be open source as long you don't obtain commercial licence
 * It has __HUGE__ test code coverage. Currently tests cover 96%+ active server side code
 * Parts of it will be published under MIT licence to be (hopefully) merged back to MEANJS. Follow our [cleanmean](https://github.com/sielayltd/cleanmean) project
 * It's still under development (see [status](#Status))
